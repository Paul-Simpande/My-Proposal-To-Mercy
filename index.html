            <p id="salutation">Hey Mama,</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container">
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInLeft">I’ve found myself thinking of you more often
                than I can count, and the feeling only seems to grow 
                stronger each day. I've wanted to put these feelings 
                into words for a while now, and though I know words 
                can never fully capture the depth of how I feel, 
                I hope this letter brings me closer to expressing 
                what my heart has been aching to say.</p>
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInRight">I sensed something unique and inexplicable about your 
                presence from the first time we met. Your warmth, 
                humour, and kindness have a way of illuminating a 
                space and attracting others to you. And once you smile, 
                it seems as though time stands still for a moment, 
                allowing me to appreciate the brightness you bring 
                into my life.</p>
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInLeft">It is found in the small things about you, such as the 
                way you listen to others as if their opinions are 
                important and the way you support and believe in them 
                even when they don't believe in themselves. </p>
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInRight">You appear in every scene of the future I envision. 
                I want to chat to you at the end of the day and 
                celebrate all of my accomplishments, no matter 
                how minor, with you. Just as you are, I want to be 
                the one that supports and loves you without conditions. 
                I would be incredibly proud to call you my own.</p>
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInLeft">This may sound like a fantasy, but it's how I feel 
                about every aspect of myself. I can't fathom my life 
                without attempting to make it a reality after seeing 
                what you've showed me. I would love nothing more than 
                to discuss this with you if there's even the slightest 
                possibility that you share my feelings.</p>
            <p class="title animate__animated animate__backInRight">So here I am, vulnerable and hopeful, asking if you’d 
                consider giving us a chance. Whatever your answer, 
                please know that you’ll always have someone who 
                admires you deeply and wishes you all the happiness 
                in the world.</p>
